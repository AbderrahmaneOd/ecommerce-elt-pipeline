# E-Commerce ELT Pipeline

## 📄 Description
This project implements an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline for processing and analyzing e-commerce transaction data from a UK-based online retailer. Using a modern tech stack, the pipeline enables efficient data ingestion, transformation, and visualization to generate actionable business insights. The entire stack is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Extraction**: Ingest raw e-commerce transaction data from CSV files.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, aggregate, and enrich data using Apache Spark.
- **Data Warehousing**: Store processed data in Hive tables for querying.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage pipeline tasks using Apache Airflow.
- **Scalability**: Leverage Hadoop for distributed data storage and processing.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Use Docker to run the entire stack seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and transformation.
- **Apache Hive**: As the data warehousing solution.
- **Apache Airflow**: For workflow orchestration and scheduling.
- **Hadoop**: For distributed storage (HDFS).
- **Docker**: For containerization of the pipeline.
